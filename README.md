## 📊 Project Overview

Costco receives millions of customer comments across platforms like Reddit, Instagram, Twitter (X), and Sitejabber. However, this feedback is often scattered, unstructured, and difficult to act on.

The **Voice of Market** project bridges that gap using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **AI-powered tools** to analyze over **400,000+ social media comments**, providing Costco with **real-time sentiment insights**, topic trends, and recommendations.

## 💡 Key Deliverables

- ✅ **Sentiment Analysis Pipeline**: VADER, BERT & CardiffNLP ensemble models.
- ✅ **Topic Modeling**: LDA and semantic similarity-based category mapping.
- ✅ **Interactive Power BI Dashboard**: Real-time trends, sentiment heatmaps, top product analysis.
- ✅ **AI-Powered Chatbot**: Built with Chainlit and Gemini Pro 1.5 for querying product insights.
- ✅ **End-to-End Preprocessing Framework**: Regex filtering, lemmatization, emoji handling, and brand-category disambiguation.
